was a clinical\n            communication tool in 92 hospitals and with over 100,000 active\n            users. Although the product had a deep userbase, the company had not\n            focused on design in it's past and end-users complained that the\n            product had grown dated, unintuitive, and frustrating. Physicians\n            were rejecting the application because it didn't support their\n            specific workflow and urgent communications were a burden. I was\n            brought on to establish a design culture within the company and lead\n            the redesign of their iOS, Android, and web applications to help\n            solve these problems.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Discovery Phase</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            Our users had highly specific and complex workflows, and we needed\n            to make sure to thoroughly research and understand them before\n            beginning. Our research included shadowing, interviewing, focus\n            groups & surveys. This ranged from observing a chaotic night shift\n            in a Manhattan ER, to scrubbing into the OR to see how surgical\n            teams communicate. As a result, we built a stronger understanding of\n            the goals & frustrations of our customers.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <LargeImageTight src={Discovery} alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Discovery\" />\n        <p>\n          We chose to follow the Lean UX Canvas for initial problem definition\n          to help us maintain focus and establish measurable outcomes. Through\n          our process, we formulated three hypotheses to measure against. In\n          addition to a complete UI redesign of the application, we focused on\n          solving the core problems around our information architecture,\n          physician workflow, and speed of urgent communications.\n        </p>\n        <LargeImageTight src={Persona} alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Persona\" />\n        <p>\n          We created personas of our core users and gave them personalities,\n          goals, and priorities. This helped us journey map ideal workflows\n          during the design phase, and maintain a user-centric perspective for\n          the other teams throughout the process.\n        </p>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Design Process</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            The culture I worked to build was one of highly rapid, transparent,\n            and collaborative design and prototyping. We began with\n            brainstorming workshops, low-fidelity sketches, wireframes, and then\n            increased in detail as our vision became more defined. Additionally,\n            we maintained a regular feedback loop with our users throughout the\n            design process.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <LargeImageTight\n          src={Sketch}\n          alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Design Process Sketch\"\n        />\n        <p>\n          Based on our user feedback, it was clear that the navigation of Mobile\n          Heartbeat needed to improve. Through card sorting studies, we were\n          able to simplify the navigation and organize related functionality\n          into intuitive groupings on the bottom tab bar.\n        </p>\n        <LargeImageTight src={Wireframe} alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Wireframe\" />\n        <p>\n          By starting with wireframes we were able to ideate rapidly with\n          minimal commitment. We met with stakeholders, SMEs, and users early\n          and often. We progressively added detail to our concepts as we\n          received buy in. Once we felt we were in a strong direction with our\n          information architecture and interaction design, we focused on\n          refining our visual design.\n        </p>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Solutions</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            When we felt we had solid concepts, we conducted extensive end-user\n            testing to validate (or revise) our solutions before implementation.\n            This included in-person user testing via InVision prototypes. We\n            conducted these tests in hospitals throughout the country, and\n            evolved our designs based on the feedback. As a result, we were able\n            to begin development with confidence in our approach.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <SolutionRow>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionOne}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution One\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              Previously, all functionality in the app was funnelled through a\n              single ’home” screen. By reorganizing our features into a bottom\n              tab bar, we could move all core functionality to single press\n              away, and with clear visual signifiers.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionTwo}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution Two\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              Enabling our power users was a major focus of ours. By introducing\n              3D Touch and long look notifications in iOS, users could access\n              deep, critical functionality from the root of the application or\n              within the context of an alert.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n        </SolutionRow>\n        <SolutionRow>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionThree}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution Three\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              To support the physician workflow better, we designed a way for\n              clinicians to select and convey their presence in multiple units\n              and facilities, as providers are often highly mobile and transient\n              throughout the hospital.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionFour}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution Four\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              Additionally, we expanded on the dynamic role feature, a critical\n              part of the physician workflow that allowed them to assign\n              themselves unique roles in the hospitals. Now users would be able\n              to search/browse, favorite, text, and assign patients to dynamic\n              roles.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n        </SolutionRow>\n        <SolutionRow>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionFive}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution Five\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              Because clinical users receive lots of communications throughout\n              the day, we needed to ensure urgent notifications were never lost.\n              To solve this, we created the ’urgent banner.” This element\n              populates every screen when triggered and can be directly actioned\n              on so the user can respond immediately. Once the notification is\n              marked as read, the banner is removed.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n          <SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionImage\n              src={SolutionSix}\n              alt=\"Mobile Heartbeat Solution Six\"\n            />\n            <SmallText>\n              To increase the speed of critical communications, we redesigned\n              the texting module. During emergencies, the user is often\n              extremely stressed with a dramatically increased cognitive load.\n              By having a clear visual indicator near the input, the clinician\n              will intuitively be able to identify and send critical texts to\n              notify the care team.\n            </SmallText>\n          </SolutionColumn>\n        </SolutionRow>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Outcome</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            At the time of this case study, we were in the process of beta\n            testing our MVP which had been well received by users. The next\n            steps were to implement NPS surveys to compare against our original\n            findings, and implement Appsee to collect analytics on the increased\n            speed of urgent communications. Additionally, we were accepted into\n            an Apple partnership program due to our adhearance to the Human\n            Interface Guidelines.\n            <br />\n            <br />\n            We learned a lot from carrying out a product redesign of this scale.\n            Platform consistency became a pain point during the design, and as a\n            response we created a design system to unify our solutions. Moving\n            forward, we would introduce this earlier in the process.\n            Additionally, for future projects I would include more engineers and\n            stakeholders in the initial discovery research, as their expertise\n            would have been valuable at that initial stage.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </OuterContainer>\n  </AboutLayout>\n)\n\nconst OuterContainer = styled.section`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.pageBottom};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    padding-right: ${Spacing.base};\n    padding-left: ${Spacing.base};\n  }\n`\n\nconst Container = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  width: ${Spacing.containerWidth};\n  padding-top: ${Spacing.xHuge};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n`\n\nconst LargeText = styled.h1`\n  font-size: ${Typography.headingFontSize};\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.xSmall};\n`\n\nconst PillContainer = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  margin-top: ${Spacing.small};\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.medium};\n`\n\nconst Pill = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  height: ${Spacing.pillHeight};\n  width: ${Spacing.pillWidth};\n  color: ${Colors.black};\n  border-radius: ${Spacing.pillRadius};\n  border: 1pt solid;\n  margin-right: 0.5em;\n  font-size: ${Typography.smallFontSize};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    width: ${Spacing.pillMobileWidth};\n    font-size: ${Typography.xSmallFontSize};\n  }\n`\n\nconst ProductDesign = styled(Pill)`\n  border-color: ${Colors.blue};\n`\n\nconst UxDesign = styled(Pill)`\n  border-color: ${Colors.orange};\n`\n\nconst CaseStudy = styled(Pill)`\n  border-color: ${Colors.green};\n`\n\nconst WelcomeText = styled.p`\n  font-size: ${Typography.mediumFontSize};\n  line-height: ${Typography.largeLineHeight};\n`\n\nconst LargeImage = styled.img`\n  margin-top: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    margin-top: ${Spacing.huge};\n    margin-bottom: ${Spacing.huge};\n  }\n`\n\nconst LargeImageTight = styled.img`\n  margin-top: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.base};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    margin-top: ${Spacing.huge};\n  }\n`\n\nconst SolutionImage = styled.img`\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.base};\n`\n\nconst Row = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n`\n\nconst SolutionRow = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-around;\n  margin-top: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    margin-top: 0;\n  }\n`\n\nconst SolutionColumn = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  align-items: center;\n  width: 21em;\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    margin-top: ${Spacing.large};\n  }\n`\n\nconst LeftHeader = styled.h2`\n  display: flex;\n  width: 100%;\n  font-size: ${Typography.headingFontSize};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    margin-bottom: ${Spacing.small};\n  }\n`\n\nconst RightContent = styled.p`\n  display: flex;\n  width: 100%;\n`\n\nconst Divider = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n  border-bottom: 1pt solid ${Colors.black};\n  margin-top: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n  margin-bottom: ${Spacing.xxHuge};\n\n  @media (max-width: ${Spacing.breakPoint}) {\n    margin-top: ${Spacing.large};\n    margin-bottom: ${Spacing.large};\n  }\n`\n\nconst SmallText = styled.p`\n  font-size: ${Typography.xSmallFontSize};\n  line-height: ${Typography.hugeLineHeight};\n`\n\nexport default MobileHeartbeatPage\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-1-68fa75c3800d1225f666f03829911161.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-design-process-sketch-5a295ff80dc9fbc05f1294be44a4bc7b.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-3-7f52d7af5a8c278dd4b62ab8cdd5e7c5.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-2-5772150e8fc411a7a867546c2c68a011.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-4-5a306417ce91dabe5bc8af3d8dbb08fa.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-5-ebbde4844bbafdd71c6d155faed466d8.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-persona-252334702e02612c454790d53bed65d0.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-discovery-a8f6724071fd2fea59cebd2ce25bb4a2.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-solution-6-d2ded9046299e65a52f072f275a272b8.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-wireframe-96cc1fdb4859eec56d5199def6b870a0.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/mh-overview-911e74f8d550733f24fc54693a257752.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
