a\n      not-so-unique problem: their suite of products, and team, were growing\n      exponentially and in unruly directions. Products lacked visual unity and\n      brand initiatives competed with each other. Developers didn't know which\n      assets to use, and velocity was slowing. We were hired for a brief\n      three-week engagement to reel things in before they spun too far out of\n      control.{\" \"}\n      <Highlight>\n        After some initial problem definition exercises, our team identified\n        that the company would benefit from a foundational design system that\n        the company could leverage, own, and grow with over time.\n      </Highlight>\n    </Background>\n    <Quote\n      quote={\n        \"My main concerns are after the engagement ends and you all turn into pumpkins, who will own this design system moving forward?

We met with stakeholders and identified with\n      the customer the elements that they wanted to keep, and which we could\n      discard. By interviewing their team, we determined that a practical and\n      flexible system would work best for their growing organization. Because\n      the engagement was limited and we wouldn't be able to build out a complete\n      system,{\" \"}\n      <Highlight>\n        I lead an exercise with the stakeholders to identify the features that\n        would be valuable in the system, individually dot vote on priorities and\n        then rank them as a group.\n      </Highlight>{\" \"}\n      This helped us align as a team before work began.\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.NeocovaExploration}\n      imageAlt={\"Design system dot map voting exercise\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Atomic design methodology\">\n      I'm a big fan of atomic design systems for larger projects, especially\n      with customers without prior design system experience. The chemistry\n      analogy is understandable and elegant, and because this client worked in\n      React, the framework translated well to React components. We chose to\n      build and maintain the system in Figma - Neocova already had strong\n      cultural adoption with this tool, and it serves as a great centralized and\n      dynamic resource to maintain a single source of truth.\n      <Divider />\n      <Highlight>\n        I've provided an example of the colors section in this case study to\n        showcase the structure of the system.
