Because there was no customer validation of\n      this concept going into the engagement, we convinced them to agree to a\n      five-day design sprint before implementation to validate the idea.\n    </Background>\n    <Quote\n      quote={\n        \"Changes to the schedule impact all aspects of the business, and it's difficult for product owners to anticipate the problems and understand the tradeoffs so they can respond proactively to them.\"\n      }\n      source={\"Problem Statement\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Understanding the business & user problems\">\n      Because Dragon worked within a complex, niche industry, we spent a large\n      portion of the Understand phase learning the business from their subject\n      matter experts. I ran a \"How Might We\" exercise where we wrote down\n      questions, concerns, opportunities, and assumptions that we formed\n      throughout the day. We then dot voted on the items to ensure they were\n      addressed during the sprint - this made sure all voices were heard and a\n      consensus was formed on the goals of the week.{\" \"}\n      <Highlight>\n        We ensured we ended the day with a problem statement and critical path\n        that we would explore on day two.\n      </Highlight>\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonNotes}\n      imageAlt={\"Product design exercise with MVP waterline\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Sketching & exploring solutions\">\n      With our initial research conducted, we began exploring solutions with\n      broad strokes.

We then did more\n      formalized solution sketches, presented them to the room, and dot voted on\n      the concepts that seemed to best address our problem statement.\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonPath}\n      imageAlt={\"Product design exercise with MVP waterline\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Coming together & forming a hypothesis\">\n      Wednesday was dedicated to our storyboard: our path forward inspired by\n      the ideas of the week that we would prototype and test. This was a\n      difficult exercise as the customer team was split on the direction\n      forward: some members were deeply rooted in their assumptions due to their\n      deep industry knowledge.{\" \"}\n      <Highlight>\n        We resolved the split by documenting all assumptions and reinforcing\n        that our decision was a hypothesis - the team would be able to respond\n        to change if our findings from the sprint invalidate the concept.\n      </Highlight>\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonStoryboard}\n      imageAlt={\"Product design exercise with MVP waterline\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Prototyping the concept\">\n      We built the prototype in Sketch and the prototype in InVision (customer\n      preference). We wrote an interview script we'd follow with each\n      participant to ensure we consistently conducted the interviews and didn't\n      miss any content. Because we only had a day to work, we focused on the\n      section of the storyboard we had the least confidence in.\n      <ButtonLink href=\"https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/GDQ9EDURFQP#/screens\">\n        <Button\n          theme={primaryLight}\n          label={\"View InVision Prototype\"}\n          icon={<FaArrowRight />}\n        />\n      </ButtonLink>\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonSolutionOne}\n      imageAlt={\"Dragon Innovation project information\"}\n    />\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonSolutionTwo}\n      imageAlt={\"Dragon Innovation risks and tradeoffs\"}\n    />\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.DragonSolutionThree}\n      imageAlt={\"Dragon Innovation critical path\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Evaluating the concept through interviewing\">\n      Thankfully, we had a solid group of eight interview participants, all\n      desired end users for the new tool.
