to gain insight into how their idols train\n      and compete. With a limited budget, a team of two had a six-week timeline\n      to design and develop a Ruby on Rails MVP that would be iterated on by\n      their internal team and eventually launched for the 2020 Olympics. The\n      product would contain a subscription service where members can join and\n      watch professional-quality videos of athletes like Shawn White or Michael\n      Phelps, with breakdowns in how they train, key takeaways of their\n      mentality to competing, and more.\n    </Background>\n    <Quote\n      quote={\n        \"By targeting high school and amateur athletes with highly personalized content, we feel we can compete with Masterclass in this space.\"\n      }\n      source={\"Product Owner, The Skills\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Is there a measurable need for this product?\">\n      <Highlight>\n        This, in addition to \"what user problem is this solving?\", are my\n        typical first questions when beginning an engagement.\n      </Highlight>{\" \"}\n      It's our responsibility to the customer to ensure we have a well-formed\n      hypothesis, backed by market and user research, before building expensive\n      custom software.

In my experience, it is\n      often difficult to convince a client to start with a small product scope,\n      launch it, and then iterate on it based on the needs and feedback of their\n      base users. Thankfully, our customer came in with a strong understanding\n      and discipline when it came to MVP scoping.\n    </SectionHeader>\n    <FeaturedImage\n      imageSrc={Images.SkillsNotes}\n      imageAlt={\"Product design exercise with MVP waterline\"}\n    />\n    <SectionHeader heading=\"Moving fast & loose with an agile approach\">\n      With our short runway, there wasn't time to run extensive preliminary\n      research or a design sprint. We relied on the interviews and persona\n      research the client collected in the past and looked to competitors for\n      inspiration and lessons. I created a rough workflow diagram and wireframes\n      to ensure we were aligned with the client on the general user journey and\n      layouts.
