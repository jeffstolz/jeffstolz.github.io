One project we worked on was the HMH\n            Marketplace, an online marketplace for educators. The following case\n            study outlines the 5-day Design Sprint that we conducted, in\n            partnership with thoughtbot, to test & validate this concept.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Understand</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            We began by defining our challenge, which was to create an online\n            marketplace for educators and content creators to buy and sell\n            digital resources. We created an affinity map to catalog and\n            organize our ideas, defined our personas, and created a basic\n            journey map to visualize the customer experience. At the end of the\n            day we determined our success metrics by following the Google HEART\n            Framework.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <LargeImageTight src={Hmw} alt=\"HMH How Might We Statements\" />\n        <p>\n          We used the ’How Might We” method to catalog our ideas and assumptions\n          in the morning. Once we had a large sample set of ideas on the board,\n          we organized them into an affinity map to identify themes and\n          categories. We then voted as a group on the ideas that we wanted to be\n          mindful of moving forward.\n        </p>\n        <LargeImageTight src={MapSketch} alt=\"HMH Journey Map\" />\n        <p>\n          Additionally, we created a rough journey map to determine how our\n          customer would experience the product. This helped us established a\n          user-centric mindset from the beginning and remain empathetic to their\n          goals throughout the week.\n        </p>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Sketch</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            Tuesday was all about rapid ideation and collaboration. After\n            conducting some industry research as a group, we created a diverse\n            set of solutions through short sketching exercises. This was a\n            refreshing experience, as many members of the sprint team were not\n            experienced product designers, and enjoyed the unique opportunity to\n            grab a pen and participate in the process.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <LargeImageTight src={SolutionSketches} alt=\"HMH Solution Sketches\" />\n        <p>\n          The morning was spent conducting various ’Crazy 8” sketching exercises\n          to rapidly ideate on rough concepts. After each round, the team\n          members presented their ideas and we voted on the viable solutions.\n          Once we had a collection of realistic options, we each focused on a\n          solution to flesh out. We gave ourselves more time to think through\n          the details and provide a presentable option to be considered for the\n          prototype.\n        </p>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Decide</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            We each presented our solution sketches to the team and used heatmap\n            voting to help us identify the most viable solutions. Our opinions\n            were originally scattered, so we created a decision matrix to help\n            us determine what to focus on. It was a grueling day, but in the end\n            we had a consensus: we would focus on the core buyer workflow of a\n            free product. We completed the day by listing our assumptions that\n            we needed to validate through user interviews.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Prototype</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            With a clear vision, it was now time to build out our solution. We\n            created a simple storyboard to map out the workflow we wanted to\n            validate. Because we only scheduled a day for prototyping, we built\n            a simple UI in Rails without any backend functionality. This gave us\n            enough to user test for Friday, while still minimizing effort.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <SolutionContainer>\n          <SolutionRow>\n            <SolutionColumn>\n              <SolutionImage src={SolutionOne} alt=\"HMH Solution One\" />\n            </SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionColumn>\n              <SolutionImage src={SolutionTwo} alt=\"HMH Solution Two\" />\n            </SolutionColumn>\n          </SolutionRow>\n          <SolutionRow>\n            <SolutionColumn>\n              <SolutionImage src={SolutionThree} alt=\"HMH Solution Three\" />\n            </SolutionColumn>\n            <SolutionColumn>\n              <SolutionImage src={SolutionFour} alt=\"HMH Solution Four\" />\n            </SolutionColumn>\n          </SolutionRow>\n        </SolutionContainer>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Validate</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            With a finished prototype, we met with our collection of users\n            consisting of teachers, developers, and a scattering of coworkers\n            around the office. We asked users to explore the application and\n            express their thoughts and opinions, and then had them to complete\n            specific, targeted tasks. This allowed us to generate an initial\n            consensus and test against our assumptions.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <Divider />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Outcome</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            After our successful design sprint, we spent the next six months\n            developing our MVP and released a public beta. The HMH Marketplace\n            beta generated over 5,000 products and 200 users within it's first\n            week of launch. Our users included Google, Microsoft, and Highlights\n            Magazine. In the end, HMH chose to focus on another direction\n            strategically, and no longer supports the marketplace. However, as a\n            team we were able to rapidly test out the solution on the market\n            with little investment in resources, which was the overall purpose\n            of our team.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n        <LargeImage src={SolutionFive} alt=\"HMH Solution Five\" />\n        <Row>\n          <LeftHeader>Reflection</LeftHeader>\n          <RightContent>\n            In retrospect, we would have done more research leading into the\n            design sprint on the market need for a product like this and the\n            problems it would solve. Additionally, we would schedule more users\n            to test with during the validation stage, as we did have to result\n            to interviewing some team members which may have skewed our results.\n          </RightContent>\n        </Row>\n      </Container>\n    </OuterContainer>\n  </AboutLayout>\n)\n\nconst OuterContainer = styled.section`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  margin-bottom: 100pt;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    padding-right: 20pt;\n    padding-left: 20pt;\n  }\n`\n\nconst Container = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  width: 700pt;\n  padding-top: 80pt;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    width: 100%;\n  }\n`\n\nconst LargeText = styled.h1`\n  font-size: 40pt;\n  margin-bottom: 10pt;\n`\n\nconst PillContainer = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  margin-top: 10pt;\n  margin-bottom: 40pt;\n`\n\nconst CaseStudy = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  border-radius: 13pt;\n  border: 1pt solid #00d332;\n  height: 26pt;\n  width: 100pt;\n  font-size: 12pt;\n  margin-right: 5pt;\n`\n\nconst ProductDesign = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  border-radius: 13pt;\n  border: 1pt solid #00b8ff;\n  height: 26pt;\n  width: 108pt;\n  font-size: 12pt;\n  margin-right: 5pt;\n`\n\nconst WelcomeText = styled.p`\n  font-size: 20pt;\n  line-height: 25pt;\n`\n\nconst LargeImage = styled.img`\n  margin-top: 100pt;\n  margin-bottom: 100pt;\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n`\n\nconst LargeImageTight = styled.img`\n  margin-top: 100pt;\n  margin-bottom: 20pt;\n`\n\nconst SolutionImage = styled.img`\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n`\n\nconst Row = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n  }\n`\n\nconst Divider = styled.div`\n  border-bottom: 1pt solid black;\n  margin-top: 100pt;\n  margin-bottom: 100pt;\n  width: 100%;\n`\n\nconst LeftHeader = styled.h2`\n  font-size: 40pt;\n  display: flex;\n  width: 100%;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    margin-bottom: 20pt;\n  }\n`\n\nconst RightContent = styled.p`\n  display: flex;\n  width: 100%;\n`\n\nconst SolutionRow = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: space-between;\n  margin-bottom: 25pt;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    justify-content: center;\n    margin-bottom: 0;\n  }\n`\n\nconst SolutionColumn = styled.div`\n  width: 48%;\n\n  @media (max-width: 950px) {\n    width: 500pt;\n    margin-bottom: 20pt;\n  }\n`\n\nconst SolutionContainer = styled.div`\n  margin-top: 100pt;\n`\n\nexport default HmhPage\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-overview-f4bbd81b58be36b6108b91fb6abbb51d.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-uxcanvas-15819f557e129232996bf5bf2b6ab58e.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-map-04d5256777c8728fd4df12a12944852b.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-sketches-be6969ef3308f6eb856d2b1a488f9114.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-solution-1-9cd616863a20649532deccb9730c42be.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-solution-2-77eaae2bf4225ece4c0c4548478d1d3d.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-solution-3-9283ac4005aaae9ccaadcaef235947d1.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-solution-4-ffcb4faea1c1f3486cbd8c35cbd44afd.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/hmh-solution-5-f412f158f3b5dabb2f2d275213e5ba99.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
